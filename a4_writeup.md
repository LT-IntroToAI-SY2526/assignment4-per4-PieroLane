# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part was coding when to keep playing the gane and reset the board. The function as won was also very diffucult because i did not know what type of code I would need to use.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add an api I think and program it specially to play the game on different levels like starter, novice, and pro all making better decisions in the game. 
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would put an if statment like if player X plays 4, then player O play 9. This information would be based off of my moves so it would simulate a real person playing you and it can make mistakes too.
